PROBLEM STATEMENT

Rahul is very fond of eating chocolates but also he is suffering from diabetes.
His friend gave him a special chocolate bar of size NxN in which every 1x1 square block has its own sweetness level.
You are given a 2-D Matrix A of size NxN where each A[i][j] represents sweetness level of that block.
In order to help Rahul you have to choose maximum K(1<=K<=N) such that there exists at least one KxK submatrix of A
which has the sum of sweetness level of all blocks belonging to that submatrix is less than or equal to D.
Note:- It is guaranteed that you will always get a K(1<=K<=N). 

INPUT   
First line contains two integers N(1<=N<=10^3) and D(1<=D<=10^18).

After first line, a NxN matrix A is given where each element has value between 1 to 10^9.


OUTPUT   
Output a single integer K.
